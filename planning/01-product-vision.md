# Product Vision

## Overview
An MCP server that dynamically discovers and exposes AppleScript-enabled macOS applications, allowing LLMs to interact with any installed app without pre-configured integrations.

## Core Value Proposition
Instead of maintaining hard-coded integrations for specific apps, the system:
- **Discovers** all scriptable apps installed on the user's Mac
- **Parses** their AppleScript dictionaries automatically
- **Exposes** their capabilities to LLMs dynamically
- **Executes** commands safely with appropriate user permissions

## Target Use Cases

### Primary
- Power users automating workflows across multiple apps
- Claude Desktop users wanting app control
- Developers using Claude Code to interact with development tools (Xcode, VS Code, etc.)
- Creative professionals automating Adobe/Sketch/Figma workflows

### Future/Claude Cowork
- Collaborative AI assistance that can manipulate local applications
- Multi-step workflows across different applications
- Research: What novel capabilities emerge when AI has full app access?

## Key Differentiators
1. **Zero Configuration**: Works with any scriptable app immediately
2. **Future-Proof**: New apps automatically supported
3. **Intelligent**: LLM learns app capabilities from dictionaries
4. **Safe**: Robust permission system with central updates

## Success Metrics (TBD)
- Number of apps successfully discovered
- User retention and engagement
- Conversion to paid tiers
- Community-created workflows/examples
