# Pricing & Licensing Strategy

**Author:** Product Strategy Analysis
**Date:** January 2026
**Context:** Bootstrap business, hot AI agentic market, novel JITD technology

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** Aggressive premium positioning with freemium model
- **Free tier:** Open source MCP bridge (developer adoption, validation)
- **Pro tier:** $19.99/month or $149/year (native app, full features)
- **Lifetime:** $299 limited early adopter (cash flow, champions)
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing (future, 18+ months out)

**Rationale:**
1. Market timing supports premium pricing (AI agentic space is hot)
2. Novel technology (JITD) justifies premium vs basic competitors
3. Freemium drives adoption, premium captures value
4. Bootstrap needs revenue velocity, not just user count
5. Can always reduce price, can't easily raise it

**Revenue Target:** $100K ARR in 18 months (1,000 Pro users @ $100 avg or 500 @ $200)

**Tiers:**
- **Free:** Open source MCP bridge only
- **Pro:** $9.99/month or $79/year
- **Lifetime:** $199 early adopter

**Target:** 2,000 Pro users × $100 avg = $200K ARR in 18 months

**Pros:**
- Low barrier to conversion (only $10)
- High volume potential (more users)
- Competitive with basic tools
- Easy to justify (less than lunch)
- Lower churn (price not painful)

**Cons:**
- Leaves money on table (market will pay more)
- Hard to raise price later (anchoring)
- Low revenue per user ($100/year)
- Need 10,000 users for $1M ARR (takes longer)
- Signals "budget tool" not "premium product"

**Break-even analysis:**
- Need 1,000 users for $100K ARR
- At 5% free→paid conversion: need 20,000 free users
- Achievable but slow

### Option 2: Aggressive Premium ($19.99/month) - RECOMMENDED

**Tiers:**
- **Free:** Open source MCP bridge (developers, validation)
- **Pro:** $19.99/month or $149/year (25% discount)
- **Lifetime:** $299 early adopter (limited availability)
- **Teams (future):** $15/user/month (5+ users)

**Target:** 1,000 Pro users × $180 avg = $180K ARR in 18 months

**Pros:**
- Premium positioning (signals quality, innovation)
- Higher revenue per user ($180/year avg)
- More margin for customer acquisition ($50-80 CAC affordable)
- Attracts serious users (better retention, less support)
- Room to discount (can offer deals, bundles)
- Justifiable by market comps (Claude Max = $20, Cursor = $20)
- JITD novelty supports premium pricing
- Can add cheaper tier later if needed

**Cons:**
- Higher barrier to conversion
- Smaller addressable market
- More price sensitivity
- Need stronger value demonstration
- Higher churn risk if value not delivered

**Break-even analysis:**
- Need 550 users for $100K ARR
- At 3% free→paid conversion: need 18,000 free users
- Fewer conversions but more revenue per conversion

**Revenue scenarios:**
- Conservative: 500 users × $150 avg = $75K ARR (Year 1)
- Target: 1,000 users × $180 avg = $180K ARR (18 months)
- Optimistic: 2,000 users × $180 avg = $360K ARR (24 months)

### Option 3: Ultra-Premium ($29.99/month)

**Tiers:**
- **Free:** Open source MCP bridge
- **Pro:** $29.99/month or $249/year
- **Lifetime:** $499 early adopter

**Target:** 500 Pro users × $280 avg = $140K ARR in 18 months

**Pros:**
- Maximum revenue per user
- Strongest margin for growth
- Premium brand positioning
- Attracts enterprise buyers

**Cons:**
- Very high barrier (risky for unproven product)
- Much smaller market
- Requires exceptional value delivery
- Competitors at lower price points
- Hard to justify without brand recognition

**Assessment:** Too risky for bootstrap MVP. Consider for v2.0 or enterprise tier.

### Option 4: Hybrid (One-Time + Subscription)

**Tiers:**
- **Free:** Open source MCP bridge
- **Standard:** $99 one-time (native app, lifetime updates for major version)
- **Pro:** $14.99/month or $119/year (adds: priority support, advanced features, beta access)
- **Lifetime Pro:** $399 one-time

**Target:** Mixed revenue (300 one-time + 400 subscription)

**Pros:**
- Appeals to both buyer types (flexibility)
- One-time provides cash flow early
- Subscription provides recurring revenue
- Can migrate one-time buyers to subscription later

**Cons:**
- Complex to explain (confusing tiers)
- Cannibalizes subscription (many choose one-time)
- Lower LTV for one-time buyers
- Support burden for old versions

**Assessment:** Adds complexity. Better to focus on one model initially.

### Option 5: Usage-Based (Per Workflow/App)

**Pricing:**
- **Free:** 3 apps, 5 workflows
- **Starter:** $0.10/workflow execution or $1/app/month
- **Unlimited:** $19.99/month

---

## Rationale for $19.99/month

### 1. Market Positioning

**Premium tier without ultra-premium risk:**
- Comparable to: Claude Max ($20), Cursor ($20), ChatGPT Plus ($20)
- Above: Basic automation tools ($10-15)
- Below: Ultra-premium ($30+)
- **Signal:** "Serious AI-powered tool, not a hobby project"

**JITD justifies premium:**
- Novel technology (no one else has it)
- Saves hours per week (demonstrable ROI)
- Works with 100+ apps (broader than competitors)
- AI-powered (commands premium)

### 2. Revenue Math

**Path to $100K ARR:**
- 550 Pro users @ $180/year average = $99K ARR
- OR: 300 annual @ $149 + 150 monthly @ $240 = $100K ARR
- OR: 200 lifetime @ $299 + 350 Pro @ $180 = $122K ARR

**Why this works for bootstrap:**
- Hit $100K with ~500-600 paying users
- At 3% conversion: need 18,000 free users (achievable)
- At 5% conversion: need 11,000 free users (conservative)
- Open source + good product → 10-20K free users in 18 months is realistic

**CAC economics:**
- Revenue per user: $180/year
- Target CAC: $30-50 (paid ads, if needed)
- LTV: $400-600 (24-30 month retention)
- LTV:CAC ratio: 8-12:1 (healthy)
- Mostly organic (free tier, content, community) → lower CAC

### 3. Customer Psychology

**$19.99 is a "sweet spot":**
- Not impulse ($9.99) but not considered ($50)
- "One streaming service" mental anchor
- "Less than one lunch/week" justification
- High enough to signal quality
- Low enough to trial without approval (personal credit card)

**Anchoring strategy:**
- Lifetime at $299 makes $19.99 seem reasonable
- Annual at $149 encourages commitment (saves $90)
- Monthly flexibility for cautious buyers

**Justification framework:**
```
$19.99/month = $0.66/day

If it saves 1 hour/week:
- Your time worth $20/hr → $80/month value
- ROI: 4:1 (pay $20, save $80 in time)

If you're a freelancer/consultant:
- Your rate $100/hr → 1 saved hour = pays for 5 months
```

### 4. Competitive Positioning

**vs Zapier ($20-50/month):**
- **Us:** Native apps, local processing, JITD
- **Them:** Web services, pre-built integrations
- **Position:** "For native apps what Zapier is for web services"
- **Pricing:** Same tier ($20) signals comparable value

**vs Keyboard Maestro ($36 one-time):**
- **Us:** AI-powered, JITD, modern
- **Them:** Manual macros, setup required
- **Position:** "Next generation automation"
- **Pricing:** Higher ($240/year) justified by AI + JITD

**vs Claude Max ($20/month):**
- **Us:** Native app automation
- **Them:** File/browser automation
- **Position:** "Complementary, not competitive"
- **Pricing:** Same ($20) → users can justify both

### 5. Growth Flexibility

**Can adjust down if needed:**
- Launch at $19.99
- If conversion low, offer 50% lifetime discount ($9.99/month)
- Or add "Basic" tier at $9.99 (limited features)
- Hard to raise price (anchoring), easy to lower

**Can add tiers:**
- Advanced tier at $29.99 (Tier 2: Accessibility APIs)
- Enterprise tier (custom pricing)
- API access (usage-based)

**Promotional strategies:**
- Early bird: First 100 customers @ $14.99/month (lifetime rate)
- Student discount: 50% off with .edu email
- Non-profit: Free Pro tier
- Annual pre-pay: $119/year (40% off, cash flow)

## Revenue Projections (18 Months)

### Conservative Scenario

**Assumptions:**
- 10,000 free users (open source + launch)
- 2% free→paid conversion = 200 Pro users
- Average revenue: $165/user/year (mix of monthly/annual)

**Revenue:**
- Pro: 200 × $165 = $33K ARR
- Lifetime: 50 × $299 = $15K one-time
- **Total Year 1: ~$48K ARR + $15K cash**

**Assessment:** Covers your costs, validates market, but below target

### Target Scenario (RECOMMENDED PLANNING)

**Assumptions:**
- 15,000 free users
- 3.5% conversion = 525 Pro users
- 100 lifetime sales
- Average revenue: $170/user/year

**Revenue:**
- Pro: 525 × $170 = $89K ARR
- Lifetime: 100 × $299 = $30K one-time
- **Total 18 months: ~$119K ARR + $30K cash**

**Assessment:** Hits $100K ARR target, sustainable, can hire part-time help

### Optimistic Scenario

**Assumptions:**
- 25,000 free users (viral launch, strong word of mouth)
- 5% conversion = 1,250 Pro users
- 200 lifetime sales
- Average revenue: $180/user/year

**Revenue:**
- Pro: 1,250 × $180 = $225K ARR
- Lifetime: 200 × $299 = $60K one-time
- **Total 18 months: ~$285K ARR + $60K cash**

**Assessment:** Exceptional outcome, can work full-time + hire 1-2 people

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Price Too High (Low Conversion)

**Indicators:**
- Free users > 10K but conversions < 2%
- Trial users don't activate Pro features
- Feedback: "Too expensive for what it does"

**Mitigation:**
- Launch annual discount: $99/year (limited time)
- Add Basic tier: $9.99/month (fewer features)
- Offer payment plans: $299 lifetime in 3 payments
- Student/educator discounts
- Free Pro for public workflows (influencer strategy)

**Trigger:** If < 2% conversion after 1,000 free users

### Risk 2: Feature Parity (Why Pay?)

**Indicators:**
- Free tier (open source) good enough for most users
- Community builds UI wrapper for free
- Hard to articulate Pro value

**Mitigation:**
- Keep proprietary features genuinely better (AI workflow builder)
- Faster development cycle on Pro features
- Support and onboarding as key differentiator
- Enterprise features (team, management) can't be open sourced easily

**Trigger:** If conversion < 1% consistently

### Risk 3: Competition (Price War)

**Indicators:**
- Competitor launches similar product at $9.99/month
- Existing tools add JITD-like features
- Market commoditization

**Mitigation:**
- First-mover advantage (community, workflows)
- Multi-platform (Windows, Linux) = broader moat
- Non-scriptable app support (Tier 2/3) = differentiation
- Brand and community (can't be copied quickly)

**Trigger:** Direct competitor with JITD at lower price

### Risk 4: Market Too Small

**Indicators:**
- Can't get to 10,000 free users in 12 months
- Limited interest in native app automation
- AI agentic space cools off

**Mitigation:**
- Pivot to narrower market (developer tools only)
- Enterprise focus (higher price, fewer users needed)
- Windows launch (14x market)
- Partner with app developers (distribution channel)

**Trigger:** < 5,000 free users after 12 months
