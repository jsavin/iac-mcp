# The Frontier Vision: AI-Powered Automation for Everyone

## The Spiritual Ancestor: UserLand Frontier

In the 1990s and early 2000s, **UserLand Frontier** revolutionized web publishing and workflow automation on the Mac. It was:

- **A scripting environment** where non-programmers could build complex workflows
- **An integration layer** that connected different Mac apps via AppleEvents
- **A democratizing tool** that empowered designers, writers, and publishers
- **Local and integrated** - it ran on your Mac, not a web service
- **The foundation** for early blogging, RSS, and template-based web publishing

**What made it special:** Frontier gave **non-technical and somewhat-technical people** the power to automate complex workflows that previously required hiring programmers. It was the bridge between creative vision and technical execution.

## The Vision: Frontier for the AI Age

We're building the spiritual successor to Frontier for the AI era.

### What It Is

**An AI-powered automation platform** that:
- Connects **Claude and other LLMs** to **applications on your computer**
- Uses **Just-In-Time Discovery** to work with any installed app automatically
- Provides a **visual, approachable interface** for creating AI-powered workflows
- Runs **locally on your Mac** (and eventually Windows/Linux), not in the cloud
- Empowers **regular people** - designers, writers, marketers, researchers, students - not just programmers

### The Core Insight

**AI makes automation accessible to everyone**, but only if:
1. It can interact with the apps people already use
2. It's local and private, not another .io service
3. It has an interface that doesn't require terminal/coding skills
4. It "just works" with any application without pre-configuration

This combines:
- **Frontier's vision** of accessible automation
- **JITD's power** to work with any app dynamically
- **AI's intelligence** to understand user intent and construct workflows
- **Local-first philosophy** for privacy and control

## What This Enables

### For Content Creators & Publishers
- "Gather research from these 10 browser tabs, organize in Notion, draft blog post in Ulysses"
- "Every morning, compile newsletter from RSS feeds, email drafts, and Twitter lists"
- "Convert this podcast transcript to blog post with images, then publish to CMS"

### For Designers & Creative Professionals
- "Batch process these Figma exports, optimize for web, and update my portfolio site"
- "Generate social media assets in 3 sizes from this master design"
- "Sync project files between Sketch, Abstract, and shared folders with version tracking"

### For Researchers & Students
- "Search academic databases, extract citations, organize in Zotero, summarize findings"
- "Convert lecture notes to flashcards, practice questions, and study guides"
- "Monitor news sources for topics, categorize, and generate weekly briefing"

### For Business Professionals
- "Pull data from these spreadsheets, generate charts, create presentation slides"
- "Process invoices from email attachments, extract data, update accounting software"
- "Aggregate project status from Slack, email, and Jira into weekly report"

### The Key Difference
These workflows **don't require pre-built integrations**. The system discovers what apps you have and what they can do, then AI orchestrates them intelligently.

## Why This Matters Now

### The Problem We're Solving

**The current state of AI automation:**
- ❌ Cloud services requiring accounts (.io startup fatigue)
- ❌ Pre-built integrations only (Zapier model - limited to what they support)
- ❌ Developer-only tools (terminal, APIs, configuration files)
- ❌ Privacy concerns (data sent to cloud)
- ❌ Subscription fatigue (another monthly fee)

**What people actually want:**
- ✅ Local control of their computing experience
- ✅ Privacy - workflows run on their machine
- ✅ Work with ANY app they have installed
- ✅ Approachable interface, not terminal commands
- ✅ Own the tool, not rent it forever

### The Frontier Parallel

**1990s web publishing:**
- Complex: Required HTML knowledge, FTP, server management
- Frontier: Made it accessible with templates, automation, visual tools
- Result: Democratized web publishing, enabled blogging revolution

**2020s AI automation:**
- Complex: Requires API knowledge, programming, cloud services
- Our Tool: Makes it accessible with JITD, visual workflows, local execution
- Result: **Democratize AI-powered automation**

## Disintermediating the AI Fluff-Startups

### The Current Landscape
Every week, new ".io" services promise AI-powered this or that:
- Require signup, subscription, data upload
- Limited integrations (only popular apps)
- Black box processing (your data in their cloud)
- Vendor lock-in (proprietary formats)
- Subscription fatigue ($10/mo + $20/mo + $15/mo...)

### Our Approach
**Give users control:**
- **Local-first**: Runs on their computer, their data stays private
- **Universal integration**: Works with ANY app through JITD
- **Transparent**: Users see and control what AI does
- **Ownership model**: Buy once or subscribe directly, no middlemen
- **Open architecture**: Extensible, not locked down

**Philosophy:** Users should control their computing experience in the AI world, just as they did in the '90s and '00s. Stop forcing them to sign up for a gazillion cloud services. Let them own their tools and workflows.

## The Product: A macOS Application (Not an npm Package)

### What It Looks Like

**A native macOS app** with:
1. **Workflow Builder** (modern outliner-style interface)
   - Visual canvas for creating automation workflows
   - Drag-and-drop components
   - Natural language descriptions → AI generates workflow
   - Test and debug workflows interactively

2. **App Discovery Panel**
   - Shows all scriptable apps installed
   - Displays capabilities for each app
   - AI-powered search: "I want to send emails" → shows Mail tools
   - Live updates when apps are installed/removed

3. **Workflow Library**
   - Pre-built workflows to get started
   - Community-shared workflows
   - Personal workflow history
   - Templates for common use cases

4. **AI Console**
   - Chat with Claude about what you want to automate
   - Claude discovers apps, suggests workflows, implements them
   - Conversational refinement: "Actually, save to Dropbox instead"
   - Permission management UI (approve operations)

5. **Execution Dashboard**
   - See workflows running
   - History and logs
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Scheduled/triggered workflows

### Not This
- ❌ Terminal commands and config files
- ❌ Node.js package requiring CLI
- ❌ Developer-focused MCP server
- ❌ Cloud-based web application

### This
- ✅ Double-click to install Mac app
- ✅ Visual interface anyone can use
- ✅ AI assistant that understands plain language
- ✅ Runs locally, privately, reliably

## Target Users: Not Just Programmers

### Primary: The "Somewhat Technical" Middle Ground
- **Content creators** managing editorial workflows
- **Designers** automating asset management
- **Researchers** processing data and documents
- **Marketing professionals** coordinating campaigns
- **Small business owners** automating operations
- **Students** organizing study workflows
- **Knowledge workers** managing information flow

These are people who:
- Use multiple apps daily
- Understand workflows conceptually
- Are NOT comfortable in terminal/code
- Want more control than Zapier provides
- Value privacy and local processing
- Will pay for tools that empower them

### Secondary: Power Users & Developers
- Can still use it programmatically via MCP interface
- Advanced scripting and customization
- Build workflows for others
- Extend with custom capabilities

### NOT Targeting (Initially)
- Pure non-technical users (too steep of learning curve)
- Enterprise IT departments (different sales model)
- Hardcore terminal-only developers (they can use MCP directly)

## Business Model: Ownership, Not Rent-Seeking

### Principles
1. **Users should own tools**, not rent them forever
2. **Local processing** means our costs are low
3. **Fair pricing** reflects value, not SaaS maximization
4. **Multiple options** for different user needs

### Options

#### Option 1: Premium Native App (Mac App Store)
- **One-time purchase** or **annual license** (like Sketch, Things)
- $49-99 one-time OR subscription pricing
- Full features, unlimited workflows
- Free updates for major version
- Mac App Store distribution
- Target: Individual professionals

#### Option 2: Freemium Native App
- **Free tier**: Basic apps (Finder, Safari, Mail), limited workflows
- **Pro tier**: All apps, unlimited workflows, advanced features
- subscription pricing or subscription pricing (cheaper than Zapier's $20/mo)
- Target: Mainstream users

#### Option 3: Developer License
- MCP server as npm package
- Free for personal use
- subscription pricing for commercial use
- Target: Developers and tech companies

#### Option 4: Enterprise (Future)
- Custom deployment
- Team collaboration features
- Centralized management
- Custom pricing
- Target: Organizations

### Why This Works
- **Lower costs**: No cloud infrastructure to run (users' machines do the work)
- **Higher value**: Works with unlimited apps (not per-integration pricing)
- **Better alignment**: Users pay for value, not lock-in
- **Sustainable**: Real revenue, not VC-subsidized race to monopoly

## Platform Strategy

### Phase 1: macOS Native App
- Largest professional user base for creative/knowledge work
- AppleScript/AppleEvents mature ecosystem
- Premium market willing to pay
- Dave Winer's original platform (fitting tribute)

### Phase 2: Windows Desktop App
- 14x larger market
- COM/PowerShell automation
- Reaches business professionals
- Same workflow paradigm

### Phase 3: Linux Desktop App
- Developer and power user market
- D-Bus automation
- Open-source friendly
- Complete desktop coverage

### Phase 4: iOS/iPad Companion
- Mobile workflow triggers
- View execution status
- Simple workflows on device
- Extends desktop experience

### Always: Local-First
Never become a cloud service requiring login. The app runs locally, talks to local LLMs or API (user's choice), processes locally.

## Technical Architecture (User-Facing)

Users don't see:
- MCP protocol
- JITD engine
- Platform adapters
- SDEF parsing

Users DO see:
- **Apps panel**: "You have 142 automatable apps installed"
- **Workflow canvas**: Visual building of automation steps
- **AI assistant**: "What do you want to automate?"
- **Permissions**: "Mail wants to send a message. [Allow Once] [Always Allow]"
- **Results**: "Workflow completed: 15 files processed"

### The AI Workflow Experience

```
User: "I want to collect all PDFs from my Downloads folder,
       extract text, and create a summary document"

App: *Discovers Finder, Preview, TextEdit, maybe Word*
     "I found:
      - Finder (to list files)
      - Preview (to extract text from PDFs)
      - TextEdit (to create summary)

      Here's what I'll do:
      1. Search Downloads for *.pdf files
      2. For each PDF, extract text using Preview
      3. Summarize the text using AI
      4. Create document in TextEdit with summaries

      [Try It] [Modify] [Save as Workflow]"

User: *clicks Try It*

App: *Executes workflow step by step*
     "Found 23 PDFs... extracting text... summarizing... done!
     Created summary document on Desktop."

User: *Saves workflow as "Summarize PDFs"*
     Can now run anytime, schedule it, or trigger from menu bar
```

## Success Metrics

### Product Success
- **Adoption**: 10K users in first year (realistic for paid Mac app)
- **Engagement**: Average user runs 5+ workflows per week
- **Retention**: 70%+ annual retention
- **Workflows**: 100K community-shared workflows in first 2 years
- **Revenue**: Sustainable business, not VC-dependent

### Impact Metrics
- **Empowerment**: Users automating tasks they previously couldn't
- **Time savings**: Average user saves 5+ hours/week
- **Creativity**: Novel workflows we never imagined
- **Education**: Users learning automation through AI assistance
- **Community**: Active sharing and collaboration

### The Dream
**5 years from now:**
- "How do you automate that?" → "I just described it to my AI and it built the workflow"
- 100K+ users across Mac/Windows/Linux
- Thousands of community workflows
- Industry standard for local AI automation
- The tool that **disintermediated the .io middlemen**

## Why This Will Work

### 1. Technology is Ready
- LLMs can understand user intent
- JITD makes universal app integration possible
- Local AI models (Claude, local LLMs) are powerful enough
- Platform automation APIs are mature

### 2. Market Timing is Right
- AI hype → real applications needed
- Privacy backlash → local-first demand
- Subscription fatigue → ownership models attractive
- Remote work → personal productivity tools valued

### 3. Clear Differentiation
- Not another cloud .io service
- Not limited to pre-built integrations
- Not developer-only
- Not enterprise-only

### 4. The Frontier Precedent
- Frontier proved non-programmers will learn powerful tools
- Frontier's market existed (publishers) → our market exists (knowledge workers)
- Frontier succeeded without cloud/SaaS → we can too
- Frontier built a community → we will too

### 5. We're Not Fighting Giants
- Apple won't build this (they make OS, not automation apps)
- Microsoft won't (wrong platform focus)
- Zapier won't (wrong business model)
- AI startups won't (they want cloud lock-in)

**This is a greenfield opportunity.**

## The Mission

**Democratize AI-powered automation** by giving everyone - not just programmers - a powerful, local, private tool to orchestrate the applications they already use, guided by AI that understands their intent.

**Disintermediate the AI middlemen** who want to be gatekeepers and rent-seekers, and give users direct control over their computing experience.

**Honor Frontier's legacy** of empowering creative people to build complex workflows without becoming programmers.

## Next Steps to Validate

1. **Build working prototype** (native Mac app, not just MCP server)
2. **Test with real non-technical users** (not just developers)
3. **Validate workflow builder UX** (can users create automations?)
4. **Measure AI assistance effectiveness** (does conversational workflow creation work?)
5. **Test pricing hypotheses** (will users pay $49-99 or prefer subscription?)
6. **Gather community workflows** (what do real users want to automate?)
7. **Build the moat** (JITD implementation, platform adapters, workflow ecosystem)

This is **not an MCP server for Claude Desktop power users**.

This is **Frontier for the AI age** - a tool that revolutionizes personal automation like Frontier revolutionized web publishing.
